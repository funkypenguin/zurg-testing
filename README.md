# zurg

A self-hosted Real-Debrid webdav server written from scratch. Together with [rclone](https://rclone.org/) it can mount your Real-Debrid torrent library into your file system like Dropbox. It's meant to be used with Infuse (webdav server) and Plex (mount zurg webdav with rclone).

2. Add your token in `config.yml`
3. `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/zurg`
4. Run `docker compose up -d`
5. `time ls -1R /mnt/zurg` You're done! If you do edits on your config.yml just do `docker compose restart zurg`.

## Why zurg? Why not X?

- Better performance than anything out there; changes in your library appear instantly ([assuming Plex picks it up fast enough](./plex_update.sh))
- You can configure a flexible directory structure in `config.yml`; you can select individual torrents that should appear on a directory by the ID you see in [DMM](https://debridmediamanager.com/). [Need help?](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/zurg-testing/wiki/Config)
- If you've ever experienced Plex scanner being stuck on a file and thereby freezing Plex completely, it should not happen anymore because zurg does a comprehensive check if a torrent is dead or not. You can run `ps aux --sort=-time | grep "Plex Media Scanner"` to check for stuck scanner processes.
- zurg guarantees that your library is **always available** because of its repair abilities!
